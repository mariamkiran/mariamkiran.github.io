I am a Computer Networking and AI Scientist and currently lead Oak Ridge National Lab’s Quantum Networking Group. My research explores AI/ML solutions for improving network performance, flexibility and high-speed distributed data transfers for science workflows. Involving themes of deep learning, software engineering and complex networks, I have developed solutions for optimizing data movement, TCP/IP protocols, learning controllers for Wide area network (WANs), wireless/5G (& Beyond) and Quantum networked devices. My research impacts DOE’s infrastructure used for high-energy physics, neutron science, materials science, biology, ecology, smart grids and nuclear energy applications.
